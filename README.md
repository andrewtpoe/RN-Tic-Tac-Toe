# Tic Tac Toe with React Native

I love tic tac toe, I also love learning new skills like React Native. This is a project for me to play with both things.

The project layout is:
  - Build the two player version of Tic Tac Toe first. Include a score counter, a turn highlighter.
  - Starting turn alternates to winner of previous match.
  - Build the one player version next, using a random selector to place the computer's marks.
  - Build an AI engine that makes the best turn for the computer.
  - Implement difficulty levels for the computers turn.

Game flow is:
  - Open to a menu screen that allows the user to select the 2 player version (this will be used later on when 1 player mode is created).
  - Once player mode is selected, allow users to enter names and select their marks.
  - Game begins once the 'Start Game' button is selected.
